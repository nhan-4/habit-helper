Habit Helper
Phase 1: Design & Planning (Week 11)
- Goal: Shape the concept and design the full user flow.

A. Figma Make Tasks
* Design the Home Screen layout (habit overview & streaks)
* Design the Habit Setup Screen (simple input form + frequency options)
* Design the Tracking Screen (daily check-off or small calendar view)
* Design the Story Screen (milestone visualization & celebration moments)
* Create responsive layouts
* Export assets, icons, and styles for later development

Phase 2: Build Basic Structure (Week 12)
- Goal: Create the base of the app and link pages together.

* Set up a simple structure using VS Code + GitHub + Vercel
* Build the main pages:
  - Home (index.html)
  - Habit Setup (setup.html)
  - Tracking (tracking.html)
  - Story (story.html)

* Connect pages with simple navigation (buttons or icons)
* Use the same styles from Figma for consistency

Phase 3: Core Interaction & Logic (Week 13)
- Goal: Make the app functional and interactive.

* Make it possible to add a new habit and save it locally
* Enable daily check-offs (mark done / not done)
* Show progress visually (streaks, small graphs, or emojis)
* When users reach milestones (1 week, 1 month, etc.), show celebration feedback
* Add gentle notifications or reminders

Phase 4: Test, Refine & Deploy (Week 14)
- Goal: Final polish and shareable version.

* Test all pages on different devices
* Fix layout or usability issues
* Refine the UI motion (transitions, small animations)
* Add simple success/error messages for better feedback
* Deploy to Vercel and share the live link
