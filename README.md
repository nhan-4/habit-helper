Habit Helper
1. What this project is
Habit Helper is a simple app that helps users build and maintain positive daily habits. It sends regular notifications to remind and motivate users to keep practicing their chosen habits consistently.

2. Who it’s for
This app is for anyone who wants to develop small but meaningful daily habits that improve their everyday life
For example:
- Drinking 2 liters of water a day
- Meditating for 10 minutes
- Stretching before bed everyday

3. Problem I’m solving
Many people struggle to stick to good habits because they forget, lose motivation, or lack a clear way to track progress.
Habit Helper solves this by providing:
- Friendly reminders
- Visual progress tracking
- Celebration of milestones
These features help users stay consistent, aware, and motivated.

4. What I want it to do
- Home screen: Shows the user’s main habit, when it started, and how many days they’ve kept it up.
- Habit setup screen: Lets users choose what habit to build and how often they want notifications.
- Tracking screen: Users can check off whether they completed their habit each day (e.g., Mon O | Tue O | Wed X), helping them visualize consistency.
- Story screen: Shows milestones (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, etc.)
and celebrates with users when each milestone is reached.

5. What I need to build
- Home screen
- Habit setup screen
- Tracking screen
- Story screen
